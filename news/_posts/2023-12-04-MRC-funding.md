Strokes represent one of the leading causes of death and disability in the UK, impacting around 100,000 patients each year.
However, with one in seven strokes seen as preventable, a new project aims to enhance health the ability to predict whether a person is at a increases risk of stroke.
Funded by a £300,000 grant from the Medical Research Council, the project is being led by experts at the University of Plymouth, working with colleagues at the University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust and the University of Exeter.

It will assess past  brain scans and other medical test rtesults of stroke survivorsand aim to establish if there are patterns which could have identified them as being a stroke risk.
The researchers will then look to develop a series of artificial intelligence models that can predict whether someone is at greater risk of experiencing a stroke at any point over the next decade.
With the first five years of care post stroke costing the NHS around £3.6billion, and 13.7% of strokes regarded as being preventable, the project team hopes its work will not only improve lives but also prove cost effective at a time when the health system is under greater financial pressure than ever.

Dr Stephen Mullin, Associate Professor in Neurology in the University of Plymouth’s Peninsula Medical School and the project’s principal investigator, said: “Strokes can have a significant impact on the people who experience them and their families. Often when we review the brain scans people who have had a major stroke, we see features - including what we call ‘silent strokes’ – that could have identified them as being at risk. We hope that by applying our expertise to create a way of improving stroke prediction, it will both prevent people developing a stroke and in the process save money which can be used to improve patient care elsewhere .”
The project, funded by the Medical Research Council, comprises researchers with expertise in health data science, data governance, statistics, radiology/imaging, and neurology.
It will initially build a database of results from patients seen at University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust, and benefits from the support and collaboration of the national Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) and NIHR South West Peninsula Academic Research Centre (PenARC).

This database will include the results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer tomography (CT) brain scans, electrocardiograms (ECG) and echocardiograms (ECGs), standard tests currently carried out when a person is suspected of having had a stroke.This data will be used to train an artificial intelligence computer model, which the researchers hope can predict who will later develop strokes based on patterns within the data collected. An opportunity will be given for patients at UHPNT to opt out of use of their data in this project,

The work will leverage state of the art techniques with artificial intelligence, collectively known as ‘explainability’. These tools allow visualisation and identification of the factors driving predictions.  This allows us to be certain that the predictions being made are accurate and will hopefully will identify new factors which contribute to the risk of developing a stroke. 
The research team – which also includes two commercial providers of medical investigations, Express Diagnostics and Ultracardiac – is currently  compiling the database which we be used in the analysis.
They will start their work in earnest in February 2024, with the project scheduled to last three years.
