There has been increasing interest in imaging research amongst radiologists but
limited opportunities to get involved as a radiology trainee. We deliver
teaching at the [Peninsula Radiology Academy](https://www.penra.org.uk/) to
radiologists on the [Peninsula PGME School of
Radiology](https://radiology.peninsuladeanery.nhs.uk/) training scheme to
improve awareness of the technologies underlying AI in radiology.
