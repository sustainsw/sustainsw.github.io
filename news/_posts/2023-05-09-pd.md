Prospective neuroprotective treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) are
highlighting the need for early diagnostic tests. MRI is not currently
considered a robust imaging test for PD, but exploratory techniques have
suggested that dedicated experimental sequences may be able to detect early
pathological brain changes. Our group have been exploring whether such changes
might be detectable in routine MRI scans by employing deep learning (DL)
methods.

This subset of machine learning has recently shown great promise in diagnostic
medical imaging, with its potential to detect patterns invisible to the human
eye. Emerging explainability methods are allowing DL predictions to be better
interpreted.
