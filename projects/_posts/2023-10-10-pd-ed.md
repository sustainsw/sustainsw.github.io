### Summary
The atypical Parkinsonian syndromes Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Multiple System Atrophy and Corticobasal Syndrome are rapidly progressive neurological conditions with a poor prognosis. Initially they may present almost identically to Parkinson’s disease. A number of promising treatments to slow down or halt the progression of these diseases are currently being tested in drug trials. Using Artificial Intelligence, we aim to train a model to identify features on MRI brain scans which may allow earlier diagnosis of the three conditions.
