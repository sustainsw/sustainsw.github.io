### Summary

Flagging the presence of cardiac devices such as pacemakers before an MRI scan
is essential to allow appropriate safety checks.

This project assessed the accuracy with which a machine learning model can
classify the presence or absence of a pacemaker on pre-existing chest
radiographs.

The project analysed a total of 7973 chest radiographs, approximately half the
dataset included cardiac devices. The chest X-ray images were reviewed by
board-cerfified radiologists to confirm correct labeling. High accuracy
(99.67%) was achieved using the machine learning model. This model could be
used to screen for patients requiring additional safety input before MRI scan
appointments.

The focus of many healthcare applications of computer vision techniques has
been for diagnosis and guiding management. This work illustrates an application
of computer vision image classification to enhance current processes and
improve patient safety.
