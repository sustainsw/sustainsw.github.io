### Summary

Flagging the presence of intracranial surgical clips for aneurysms before an MRI
scan is essential to allow appropriate safety checks to take place.

This project assessed the accuracy with which a machine learning model could
classify the presence or absence of intracranial aneurysm clips on pre-existing
imaging data.

This project analysed a total of 246 CT head studies, half of which
had aneurysm clips present. An explainable AI technique called SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) was used to calculate and visualise the contribution of
individual pixels to the predictions. This highlighted that appropriate regions
of interest were informing the output of the models.

The model could be used to screen for patients requiring additional safety
input before MRI scan appointments.

The focus of many healthcare applications of computer vision techniques has
been for diagnosis and guiding management. This work illustrates an application
of computer vision image classification to enhance current processes and
improve patient safety.

The results have been accepted for publication in the [Journal for Digital
Imaging](https://link.springer.com/journal/10278).
