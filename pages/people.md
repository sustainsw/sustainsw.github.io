        {% capture intro_michael_allen %}
        Mike is a Senior Research Fellow in Applied Healthcare Modelling and
        Data Science in the <a href="https://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/">University of Exeter Medical School</a>. After nearly
        20 years in Pharma R&D Drug Discovery, he switched to academia to focus
        on research that maximises NHS benefits from new treatments. He has a
        life-long interest in combining biomedical and computer sciences, and
        believes we're now living in the age that he so looked forward to -
        where computer science ('AI') is matching biomedical science in what it
        can offer to medicine.

        Currently his work mostly involves looking at variation in healthcare
        between hospitals, looking at what different hospitals do differently,
        and how that affects patient outcomes. He uses modelling and AI to ask
        the question "What would happen if my patient went to another hospital?
        What would they do, and what would the patient outcome be?"
